# Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. In this project, we worked to understand the results of an A/B test that was preform by an e-commerce website. The goal of this project is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The project has three parts:
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - Regression
